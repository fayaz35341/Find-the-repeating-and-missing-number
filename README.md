Given an integer array nums of size n containing values from [1, n] and each value appears exactly once in the array, except for A, which appears twice and B which is missing.



Return the values A and B, as an array of size 2, where A appears in the 0-th index and B in the 1st index.



Note: You are not allowed to modify the original array.


Example 1

Input: nums = [3, 5, 4, 1, 1]

Output: [1, 2]

Explanation:

1 appears two times in the array and 2 is missing from nums

Example 2

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 5, 7]

Output: [7, 4]

Explanation:

7 appears two times in the array and 4 is missing from nums.

Now your turn!

Input: nums = [6, 5, 7, 1, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2]

Output:
